vico-fill-in-the-blanks.tmbundle
================================

This bundle is meant to fill in any blanks between vico and vim that I feel a
need for. Put differently, when I run into a feature that I use in vim that
vico doesn't have and I see it's implementable using vico's Nu scripting, I try
to throw it in here.

Things Implemented
------------------

* zz -- zz centers the scroll on the current line.
  
  This implementation one-ups the vim implementation by allowing you to center
  both the top and bottom lines on the screen (i.e., by adding blank space above
  and below the beginning and end lines if needed to center the line
  appropriately). That's more by accident than anything else.
